    "\n",
    "The simplest example of classification is binary classification, where there are only two labels you can predict. One example is fraud analytics, where a given transaction can be classified as fraudulent or not; or email spam, where a given email can be classified as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond binary classification lies multiclass classification, where one label is chosen from more than two distinct possible labels. A typical example is Facebook predicting the people in a given photo or a meterologist predicting the weather (rainy, sunny, cloudy, etc.). Note how there is always a finite set of classes to predict; it’s never unbounded. This is also called multinomial classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multilabel Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is multilabel classification, where a given input can produce multiple labels. For example, you might want to predict a book’s genre based on the text of the book itself. While this could be multiclass, it’s probably better suited for multilabel because a book may fall into multiple genres. Another example of multilabel classification is identifying the number of objects that appear in an image. Note that in this example, the number of output predictions is not necessarily fixed, and could vary from image to image."
