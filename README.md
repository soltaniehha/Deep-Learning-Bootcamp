# Deep-Learning-Bootcamp
Introduction to deep learning with Python

We start with an overview of the basics`pandas` and `scikit-learn` to pre-process our data and perform simple machine learning tasks. We then dive into `Keras` with `tensorflow` backend and focus on some of the most common applications of deep learning.
