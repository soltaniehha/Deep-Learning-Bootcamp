This consistent, clean, and standard format is called **tidy data**. What exactly this tidy format is might not be something that everyone agrees on, but there are aspects of it that are agreeable. Here we will go over some of these methods, will introduce tools provided by **pandas**, and by using them will show examples on how to tidy our data and how to join multiple tidy datasets to get the appropriate data we need in our reporting and analysis.\n","\n","It is typical for a data science project to spend significant amount of time in tidying, transforming and manipulating the data. This is a crucial part of the project that is sometimes overlooked; the output only can get as good as the input, spending some upfront time on the data usually pays off in the end.\n","\n","## Tidy data\n","You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways. The example below shows the same data organized in four different ways. Each dataset shows the same values of four variables `country`, `year`, `population`, and `cases`:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hV-kvZ7YzKdk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605503461269,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1550,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammad Soltanieh
